 Security Learnings from an old fart

Hello and welcome to my OSINT Security Repo.

The purpose of this repository is to share my experience and resources back to the community. This community has been amazing to me, and the only thing I can do is to give back my experiences and the things Iâ€™ve garnered over the years. 

So, with that, I will bring on the resources and anecdotal stories. 

TLDR: This community has been amazing, and below are tips, tricks, and resources to aid you in your mission.

## Data Sources:

## Local Data Sources

Local Tax Database - Many municipalities have a tax database that you can search for property information. This information is usually public and can be used to find out who owns a property or what property someone owns.

Local Criminal Database - Many municipalities and or prison systems utilize a "mug shot" database which is invaluable if the event is fairly recent.

Local Court Database - Many municipalities have a court database that you can search for court cases. This information is usually public and can be used to find out if someone has been involved in a court case.

**Note:** Many of these databases are not indexed by Google and will not show up in a Google search. You will need to find the website for the municipality and search the website for the database.

### Social Media: 

**Note** - Social Media is a great way to gather information about a target. However, it is also a great way to get caught. If you are going to use social media, make sure you are using a VPN and a browser that does not have any of your personal information in it. Also, make sure you aren't logged in to any of your personal accounts. You'd be surprised how many people forget this.
